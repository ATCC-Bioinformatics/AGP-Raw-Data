# AGP-Raw-Data
This repo serves to provide a consistent source for the URLs pointing to the raw data used to create the assemblies in the [ATCC Genome Portal](https://genomes.atcc.org). Our raw data is stored on MS Azure as a blob storage object. Here we provide a simple CSV that will be periodically be updated to include:
1. ATCC Strain Name
2. URL to MS Azure Blog Storage of raw FASTQ for both Illumina and ONT data for this assembly.
